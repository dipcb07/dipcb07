# Welcome! I'm Dip Chakraborty.

This is my rough lab – where I experiment, break things, and occasionally build stuff based on sudden ideas that might work… or might explode. :3

Most of these projects are raw, or half-baked. I use this space to test tech, explore frameworks, and prototype wild ideas before shipping the real deal.
